        <h2>What are Galaxies?</h2>
        <p>Galaxies are enormous systems of stars, gas, and dust that are held together by gravity. There are billions of galaxies in the universe, each with its unique shape and properties. Astronomers study galaxies to learn more about the structure and evolution of the universe.</p>

        <h2>The Shapes of Galaxies</h2>
        <p>There are three main shapes of galaxies:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spiral galaxies:</strong> Spiral galaxies have a disk-shaped structure with a central bulge and spiral arms extending outwards. Our Milky Way galaxy is an example of a spiral galaxy.</li>

          <li><strong>Elliptical galaxies:</strong> Elliptical galaxies are shaped like a sphere or an egg and have no visible structure like spiral arms. They are made up of mostly old stars.</li>

          <li><strong>Irregular galaxies:</strong> Irregular galaxies have a chaotic and disorganized shape with no defined structure. They are often smaller than spiral and elliptical galaxies and contain both young and old stars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Discovery of Galaxies</h2>
        <p>The discovery of galaxies began in the early 20th century when astronomers observed faint, fuzzy objects in the night sky. At that time, they thought these objects were clouds of gas and dust called nebulae.</p>

        <p>However, in 1924, American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered a Cepheid variable star in one of these objects, known as the Andromeda Nebula. He was able to measure the star's brightness and determine that the object was much farther away than previously thought, and was, in fact, a separate galaxy. This discovery led to the realization that the universe was much larger than previously thought and contained billions of galaxies.</p>

        <p>Hubble went on to develop a classification system for galaxies based on their shapes, known as the Hubble sequence. This system is still used today to classify galaxies.</p>
